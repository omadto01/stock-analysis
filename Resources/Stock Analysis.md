# Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 

To provide perform Stock analysis for 2017 and 2018 using Visual Basic (VBA) and provide outcome of result to our client Steve.

## Analysis and Challenges

Using the following information on stock analysis excel for year 2017 and 2018. I began identifying which stock has decrease and increase for both year and comparing the outcome based on percentage. While refactoring the code on VBA.

### Analysis in Year 2017

In year 2017 the return for all the Ticker count as a positive return to almost of stocks with the exception of TERP with -7.2% return. The highest return that generated in all stock is DQ ticker with the return of 199.4%

### Analysis in Year 2018

In year 2018 the return for all the Ticker count as a negative return to almost of stocks with the exception of ENPH and RUN with return of 81.9% and 84.0%. The lowest return that generated in all stock is DQ ticker with the return of -62.6%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge and difficulties encountered are the VBA would not ran and would not tell me the error I need to fix and looping.


## Results

- The code ran for both 2017 and 2018 Stock analysis is 0 seconds.
- By using (yearValue) it made the code run efficiently by prompting me to select the year I want to run instead of creating different module and entering Year 2017 and 2018.
- In 2017 the return DQ has generated return of 199.4% and in 2018 DQ ticker has dropped to -62.6%.
- Ticker stocks ENPH and RUN has been fairly consistent. ENPH has dropped a bit from return 129.5% to 81.9% and as for RUN has increase its return from 5.5% to 84.0%.
